[i]“I believe that all apps should respect the end-user’s privacy. I also believe that this App should be free in order for it to be able to reach as many people as possible, regardless of the end-user’s financial situation, in the hope that if someday they find themselves in the need of help it can be helpful to them.

Everybody, including myself, goes from time to time through difficult times. If you would like to support me I will be forever thankful to you for doing so.”[/i]
