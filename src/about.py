[b][u]IMPORTANT!!! - PLEASE READ!!![/u][/b]


This app requires ALL three permissions (LOCATION, CALL_PHONE, SEND_SMS) in order to be able to work properly.

[u][i]After the permissions have been granted, the App needs to be closed and [b]manually[/b] restarted to be able to initialize the GPS with the new configuration.[/i][/u]

This is only needed to be done once. After the first restart the app should retain the granted permissions for future use.


If you accidentally missed/forgot to grant all necessary permissions you can do the following:
    
  Option 1:
    - Close App
    - Restart the App
    - Grant all three permissions on App start
    - If the permission popup do not come back then perform the steps explained in Option 2
    
  Option 2:
    - Uninstall App
    - Reinstall App
    - Start App
    - Grant all three permissions on App start
    

Additionally make sure that the GPS on your phone is turned on. This can be achieved by toggling on the Location switch in the phone Settings or by tapping the Location icon on your phone.

If this is not done beforehand, even if the GPS permissions were granted, the App [b]WILL NOT[/b] work properly because the GPS will be off.


[u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u]

Please be aware that additional charges from your telephone service provider could be incurred when sending SOS messages (SMS) or calling emergency contacts.
