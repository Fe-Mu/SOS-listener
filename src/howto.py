[b]Location Messages[/b]

Sending a SOS-Message will also share the current Location of the person requesting the help in the form of a link that can be opened either on the Magic Earth App or on the Google Maps App. These apps need to be previously installed in order for the links to be able to be opened there.

    1. Magic Earth is the recommended App to open shared Location coordinates due to its privacy-oriented nature which aligns with SOS-listener's commitment to respect the end-user's privacy. Additionally Magic Earth offers the possibility to download (at no cost) offline maps for entire and multiple countries across the world if desired. This allows the sender and the receiver to share and pinpoint any Location coordinates in an offline map when no internet connectivity is available (as long as the region was previously downloaded in Magic Earth).
    2. Google Maps was chosen as the second App to open shared Location coordinates due to its popularity and wide adoption across multiple devices and countries. 

Disclaimer: The developer or this App has no affiliation, support or relationship with/from Magic Earth or Google in any way.


[b]Activate the Quick-Call Emergency-Buttons[/b]

This App comes with three (deactivated by default) buttons at the top of the main screen.

    2. When the new popup window opens, write a new emergency number in one of the text fields next to the label -- Emergency Nr. 1, 2 or 3-- and toggle the switch next to it to the ON state.
    3. The color of the -- Emergency Nr. -- label will match, as a result, the color of the button that later will be displayed in the main screen.
    4. Click on the "Update" button at the bottom of the screen.
    5. The activated button will be available for its use at the top of the main screen in the chosen color.

    7. Close and restart the App to automatically load the imported emergency-contacts.


[b]Manually Update App[/b]

[u]Before a manual App update make sure you make first a backup of your emergency-contacts (see above), since manually updating the App will delete the existing emergency-contacts.[/u]

At the end of the following steps you should end up with a single and updated App installation. The update should NEVER create a duplicate of the App. If you notice a duplicate was created after the update it could mean it is not the original APK published by the developer. Uninstall the App duplicate, delete the recently downloaded APK and please inform the developer about this.

To update the App:

    1. Go to [u]https://github.com/Fe-Mu/SOS-listener/releases[/u] and download the newest/latest App release from the official GitHub Repository.
    2. Go to the location where the APK was downloaded (usually the Downloads folder).
    3. Tap on the downloaded APK and click on install and proceed with the installation steps that will follow. If during the installation you receive a message that there is a problem with the Signature it could mean that the App was tampered by someone else and therefore the Signatures of the original APK and the new APK do not match. In such case Android should prevent the installation since this is a security issue. In such case do not install the new APK and please inform the Developer about this.
    4. If everything went well the App should now have the latest updates.


[b]Activate/Deactivate the light-theme[/b]

    1. Tap on the "Add/Manage Buttons" button in the main screen.
    2. When the new popup screen opens, toggle the light-theme switch at the top of the window to the desired ON/OFF state.
    3. The new theme will be automatically applied and displayed on the main screen.
